a/ Directory
============

These packages are needed for all systems, they are not optional.

Generally you should install these packages and never uninstall them.  Upgrading
them should work without issue.

Included are:

* aaa_base - Base file system directory structure
* busybox - Single tool to replace most common shell utilities
* musl - libc, only the dynamically linked libraries (no headers / static libs)
* pkgtools - Slackware package manager tools (with some features removed)
